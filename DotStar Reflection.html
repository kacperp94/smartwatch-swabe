The whole project was an interesting experience and throughout the time our idea was changed  lot. 
It makes me thing that what we didn't put enough effort to the planning process and initially tried to rush things.
It resulted in doing a lot of unnecessary work that was never used in the final project.
However, I might use this knowledge in the future, so it's not totally wasted time.
Another challenge was our unfamiliarity with C and the fact that we worked on Pebble and there wasn't nearly as many resources available as we would like.
Initially, we divided the workload in two teams, but as we progressed it merged since the task was harder than expected.
Overall I think that it was an interesting experience to work on a group project like this and it probably gave me an accurate idea what's going on in the start-up world.
